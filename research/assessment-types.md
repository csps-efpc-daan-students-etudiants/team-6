# Purpose
Outline different methods of assessment and the data that can be gained from each.

# Caveats
* Multiple choice and binary provide hints and can be guessed.
* Subjective answers (freeform text/illustration) are more difficult to assess than objective.
* Qualitative answers are more diffcult to assess than quantitative.

# Assessment types
Taken from this [assessment article](https://as.exeter.ac.uk/tqae/academicdevelopment/assessmentandfeedback/principlesofassessment/typesofassessment-definitions/).

## Formative assessment
* Learner's ongoing progress towards learning a skill or concept.
* Does not contribute to final mark.
* Given throughout teaching a unit.

## Summative assessment
* Learner's overall success in meeting assessment criteria.
* Contributes to final mark.
* Normally given at end of unit of teaching.

## 'Authentic' or work-integrated assessment
* Assessment where tasks/conditions are closely aligned to employment

## Diagnostic assessment
* Similar to formative, but looks at learner's existing skill or understanding.
* Looks for difficulties the learner might have that could limit future learning.

## Dynamic assessment
* Assess how the student performs on an unfamiliar topic.
* Used to assess general learning potential and reasoning skills.
* Normally occurs at the beginning of teaching a unit.

## Synoptic assessment
* Assess ability to integrate and apply knowledge from multiple domains.
* Tests students capability to apply knowledge gained in one module of a unit to another module in the unit.
* Synoptic assessment can be part of other forms of assessment.

## Criterion referenced assessment
* Asses learner achievement against specific criteria.
* Controls for how the learner's cohort is performing since it does not take this into consideration.

## Ipsative assessment
* Assess learner against own previous standards (learner's average attainment, against best work, against most recent piece of work).
* Tends to correlate with effort.

# Question types
Examples of [question types and sub-types](https://www.slideshare.net/geraldxdiana/multiple-choice-test-type-questions).

## Binary
* True/false
* Single correct
* Single incorrect

## Likert scale
* Scale of agreement/disagreement with a statement

## Multiple choice
* 1 correct
* 1 incorrect
* 0-many correct
* 0-many incorrect
* Many potentially correct answers, 1 correct
* Many potentially incorrect answers, 1 incorrect

## Sorting/ranking
* Sort like concept
* Sort concepts into pre-defined groups
* Rank best to worst
* Rank worst to best

## Matching
* Match related concepts
* Imperfect matching (options that have no match)

## Fill in the blanks
* Add missing word (freeform)
* Add missing word (from list of options)
* Add missing phrase (freeform)
* Add missing phrase (from list of options)
* Enumeration (provide list of missing options)

## Word association 
* Provide word(s) related to a concept

## Short answer
* Provide short answer

## Essay answer
* Provide long answer

## Illustration
* Draw a concept
* Fill in missing section of a drawing

## Performance task (complete a task or assignment)
* Complete task independently
* Complete task while being observed

# Data from question types
The different types of assessment data we can get from capturing metrics on how learners answer questions.  

:warning: All time evaluations should be based only on the learner's established pace.  This should allow us to isolate how effective the training was at the individual level. 

## Explicit
* Answer
* Quality of the answer (in the case of non-binary questions)
* Quality of answer compared to other questions within same module.

## Implicit
* Length of time between question load and answer entered (but not submitted).
* Length of time between question load and answer submitted.
* Total length of time to complete series of questions or assignment.
* Length of time to answer questions when familiar topic.
* Length of time to answer questions when unfamiliar topic.
* Length of time to answer simple vs. complex questions.
* Number of times revised answer.
* Number of times revisted question.

:warning: **Notes:** 

* Assess understanding with multiple different question types and question delivery methods.  This will help accomodate diverse abilities in the learners;
  * Written
  * Audio
  * Video
  * Explained by the teacher
* Open ended questions provide more chance to demonstrate deeper understanding of a topic.
```javascript
10 = ____ + 1  // one correct answer: 9
```
vs.
```javascript
10 = ________  // multiple correct answers: 10, 9 + 1, 8 + 2, 5 * 2, 50/5, etc.
```
