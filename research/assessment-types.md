# Purpose
Outline different methods of assessment and the data that can be gained from each.

# Caveats
* Multiple choice and binary provide hints and can be guessed.
* Subjective answers (freeform text/illustration) are more difficult to assess than objective.
* Qualitative answers are more diffcult to assess than quantitative.

# Assessment types
Taken from this [assessment article](https://as.exeter.ac.uk/tqae/academicdevelopment/assessmentandfeedback/principlesofassessment/typesofassessment-definitions/).

## Formative assessment
* Learner's ongoing progress towards learning a skill or concept.
* Does not contribute to final mark.
* Given throughout teaching a unit.

## Summative assessment
* Learner's overall success in meeting assessment criteria.
* Contributes to final mark.
* Normally given at end of unit of teaching.

## 'Authentic' or work-integrated assessment
* Assessment where tasks/conditions are closely aligned to employment

## Diagnostic assessment
* Similar to formative, but looks at learner's existing skill or understanding.
* Looks for difficulties the learner might have that could limit future learning.

## Dynamic assessment
* Assess how the student performs on an unfamiliar topic.
* Used to assess general learning potential and reasoning skills.
* Normally occurs at the beginning of teaching a unit.

## Synoptic assessment
* Assess ability to integrate and apply knowledge from multiple domains.
* Tests students capability to apply knowledge gained in one module of a unit to another module in the unit.
* Synoptic assessment can be part of other forms of assessment.

## Criterion referenced assessment
* Asses learner achievement against specific criteria.
* Controls for how the learner's cohort is performing since it does not take this into consideration.

## Ipsative assessment
* Assess learner against own previous standards (learner's average attainment, against best work, against most recent piece of work).
* Tends to correlate with effort.
