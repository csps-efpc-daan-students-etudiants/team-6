# Data

## Explicit
Provided by the user.

* Interactive question results
* Assignment results
* Test results
* Surveys
* Open ended question (subjective evaluation needed to gauge quality of the response)
* Quality of the response (e.g. multiple choice with a range of correct answers)
* Overall grade in the course
* User profile (self-reported):
  * current position
  * existing skills
  * experience
* Measure of engagement (notify the instructor that more focus is needed)
* Time on task (explicitly pausing an activity with a timer)

## Implicit
Provided by the user's interactions

* Number of tries to be successful
* Time on task (in course)
  * Expected time vs. reality
  * Did they guess
* Time on task (at work)
  * Expected time vs. reality
  * What kinds of tasks
  * What features
  * How often
  * How many different reports are they working (frequency and variety of reports)  
* Participation in interactive portions of the course
* Number of requests for support
* Duration of support required
* Length of time between support request and receiving support
* Attendance
* Number of edits to a multiple choice or open ended question
* Performance of learners related to:
  * delivery method (instructor led, self-paced, in-person, remote) 
  * course location
  * time of year
  * time of day
  * length of course

# Correlation
How are these data types related to learning outcomes (or each other)

## Changes in learner performance over the course is an indicator of course quality. 
* Pre-assessment of the learner's skills is required.
* Improvement can be judged by performance on questions, assignments, tests (explicit)

## Number of requests for instructor support is an indicator of course quality.
* More requests indicates a lack of understanding.
* Changes in number of requests indicates pacing issue with the course.

## Speed of response indicates user understanding.
* Answering quickly implies understanding.
* Answering too quickly implies guessing.
* Must be careful to consider accessibility.

# Causation
~~How are these data types indicators of successfully acquiring a competency~~ (needs work, potentially not needed or possible)

:warning: **Note:** 
* Must be cautious of putting too much burden on the user.
* Must be careful about making speed assumptions (may be accessibility concerns)
* Must conform to GC standards on useability, language and accessibility
* Ease-of-use is key!
* Ease of creating course or supporting course material is also important.  This may end up being a bolt-on to an existing course.
