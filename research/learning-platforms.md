# Purpose
Research existing software to see if there's a good fit for our evaluation app concept.  Features we'd like are:

* Assessment of student before, during and after class.
* Polling and surveys.
* Interactive questions.
* In-class assignments.
* **ALL the data** on the student's performance; both self reported and implicit (e.g. level of difficulty answering a question, requests for support, time taken to complete an assignment, quality of the assignment).

# Options
* [Moodle](https://moodle.org/): learning platform that provides educators, administrators and learners with a system to create personalised learning environments.
* [Sli.do](https://www.sli.do/): capture questions, poll the class and perform brainstorming.
* [Wooclap](https://www.wooclap.com/): similar features to `Sli.do`, but with more [interactive learning options](https://www.wooclap.com/en/features/votes/).
