# Purpose
Research existing software to see if there's a good fit for our evaluation app concept.  Features we'd like are:

* Assessment of student before, during and after class.
* Polling and surveys.
* Interactive questions.
* In-class assignments.
* **ALL the data** on the student's performance; both self reported and implicit (e.g. level of difficulty answering a question, requests for support, time taken to complete an assignment, quality of the assignment).

# Requirements
High level, unsorted requirements for our evaluation app:

* All components should be open source or have a license compatible with open source projects.
* Multilingual (French/English).
* Accessible (e.g. WCAG 2.0 AA).
* Must be able to work as a bolt-on to an existing class (integrate with an existing delivery method that doesn't have the evaluation features and data we're looking for).
* Should work for in-person and remote training.
* It would be nice if self-directed and branching learning on topics was supported.
* The more platforms supported the better.  Ideally Apple, Android and web for devices.  At the minimum, web to increase chance that students have a compatible device.

# Existing software options
* [GoClass](#goclass): classroom teaching assistant.  Allows teachers to plan and deliver interactive lessons.
* [Moodle](#moodle): learning platform that provides educators, administrators and learners with a system to create personalised learning environments.
* [Nearpod](#nearpod): interactive lessons with students, real-time feedback and post-session reports (data can be imported into LMS).
* [Slido](#slido): capture questions, poll the class and perform brainstorming.
* [Socrative](#socrative): another interactive learning platform.  Seems more focused on supporting an existing lesson plan rather than managing the lesson plan content.
* [Wooclap](#wooclap): similar features to `Sli.do`, but with more [interactive learning options](https://www.wooclap.com/en/features/votes/).
