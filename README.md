# Vision
Develop a data collection and feedback application that tracks progress of a learner before, during and after training.

Analyse the DND data set to look for insights and data gaps.  The goal is to:
* Measure the mipact of the data literacy training; and
* Identify cohorts that the training was beneficial for.
