# Problem
How can we know that training is improving Government services?  Our problem comes from DND and their need to have a data literate work force.

# Vision
## Analyse the DND training data set to look for insights and data gaps
* Measure the impact of the data literacy training on DND staff; and
* Identify cohorts that the training was beneficial for.

## Develop a data collection and feedback application ([Evalapp](https://csps-efpc-daan-students-etudiants.github.io/team-6/prototype/))
* Track progress of a learner before, during and after training;
* Allow a learner to gauge their progress;
* Allow an organizatino to guage the progress of their learners and develop a skills inventory; and
* Provide richer data to look for training impact.

# Competency model
As part of our work, we developed a [data literacy competency model](https://github.com/csps-efpc-daan-students-etudiants/team-6/blob/master/research/Data%20Literacy%20Comptencies.xlsx) with proficiency levels.

# Prototype
We developed clickable mockups of the [evaulation app and student dashboard](https://csps-efpc-daan-students-etudiants.github.io/team-6/prototype/) to start user testing.  The next stage would be to hook these mockups to a quiz engine so we could start collection real user data about learner performance.

# Pitch presentation
At the end of the practicum, we presented our [solution pitch](https://github.com/csps-efpc-daan-students-etudiants/team-6/blob/master/presentations/solution-pitch-final.pdf) to the Digital Acadey and a panel of judges.
