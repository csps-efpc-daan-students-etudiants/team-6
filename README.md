# Problem
How can we measure the impact of training so we can track an individualâ€™s progress towards data literacy. This in turn will help organizations decide how best to direct training resources.

# Vision
## Analyse the DND training data set to look for insights and data gaps
Goals:
* measure the impact of the data literacy training on DND staff; and
* identify cohorts that the training was beneficial for.

## Develop a data collection and feedback application (evaluation app)
Goals:
* track progress of a learner before, during and after training;
* allow a learner to gauge their progress;
* allow an organizatino to guage the progress of their learners and develop a skills inventory; and
* provide richer data to look for training impact.

# Prototype
We developed clickable mockups of the [evaulation app and student dashboard](https://csps-efpc-daan-students-etudiants.github.io/team-6/prototype/) to start user testing.  The next stage would be to hook these mockups to a quiz engine so we could start collection real user data about learner performance.
